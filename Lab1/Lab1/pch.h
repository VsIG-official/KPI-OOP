// pch.h: this is a precompiled header file.
// The files listed below are compiled only once, which speeds up subsequent builds.
// It also affects the operation of IntelliSense, including many code review and termination functions.
// However, changing any of the files listed here between build operations will result in a second compilation of all (!) of these files.
// Do not add files that you plan to change frequently, as there will be no performance gain.
